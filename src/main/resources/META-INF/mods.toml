The community Tuff Golem is here and ready to become part of your Minecraft family!

Make them useful workers with collecting and organizing loot, or keep them as a fun companion around the house!

-Use them as little workers going to and from your farms collecting loot.
-Create a path for them to walk to and from specific areas using redstone lamps.
-Stack them on top of each other and keep them around as statues or totems around your home.
-Give them wheat and other animal food to draw in specific animals.
-Turn them into moving display cases by having them take an item from your frame and walk it around, then put it back. (optional)
-Just let them roam around in your home, picking up the trash and displaying any item or block you want!

With these little fellas in your house, you'll have a Tuff time parting with them!
